      OpenTED releases updated data extracts from the European procurement database, <a href="http://ted.europa.eu/TED/main/HomePage.do">Tenders
        Electronic Daily (TED)</a>. The data on this site is machine-readable CSV, ready for 
        examination by journalists and others. Since the EU Publications Office does not make 
        such a form of the data available, the content has been generated through an automated
        scraper script, which downloads and analyses the TED web site.
