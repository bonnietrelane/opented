    <p class="teaser">
    Welcome to OpenTED, an initiative that aims to make information from
    the joint European procurement system more easily accessible to
    journalists and researchers. The project aims to answer such questions
    as: Who are the biggest suppliers to a local government? What goods
    and servies are the public bodies in a particular country purchasing?
    Are anti-corruption procedures being followed correctly?
    </p>

    for our latest updates.</p>

    <h2 id="what-is-ted">What is TED?</h2>

    <p>Each year the public sector across countries contracts private
    providers to serve the public. From local municipalities to publicly
    owned utility companies the public engages companies to clean
    schools, to run servage operations and to build bridges. According
    to <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/gov_glance-2011-en/09/01/gix-40-01.html?contentType=/ns/StatisticalPublication,/ns/Chapter&amp;itemId=/content/chapter/gov_glance-2011-46-en&amp;containerItemId=/content/serial/22214399&amp;accessItemIds=&amp;mimeType=text/html">OECD estimates</a> government spending on private
    sector procurement ranges from 5 per cent of GDP in Mexico to 26 per
    cent of GDP in the Netherlands, with an OECD average of 17 per cent
    of GDP.</p>

    <p><strong>Access to public procurement data</strong></p>
    <p>According to the EU rules on public procurements all contracts
    valued above €200,000 are mandated to be published as a public procurement
    contest. Since 2006 EU has published procurement statements on +700,000
    tenders at the <a title="TEd-register website" href="http://ted.europa.eu/">
    Tender Electronic Daily (TED)</a>.</p>

    <p>TED is the official online version of the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Journal_of_the_European_Union">
    Supplement to the Official Journal of the European Union</a>, which
    publishes all public procurement made in member states, which falls
    under the minimum amount of procurement. Depending on the type of
    contract (from service to works) public owned agencies are mandated
    to publish all tenders above minimum amounts stipulated in the EU
    regulation. The TED-register includes data on awarded procurement
    contracts from publicly owned entities – such as EU agencies, governments,
    provinces, municipalities and publicly owned utility companies.</p>

    <p>At OpenTED we believe that the data from the TED-register can be
    a valuable source for journalists, NGOs, analysts and citizens for
    getting information on everything from large scale trends to local
    municipal developments.</p>

    <h2 id="get-the-data">Get the data</h2>

    <p>TED data is shared by the EU Publications Office in a XML format.
    While that format is well-suited to automated processing, it doesn't
    easily lend itself to analysis by journalists. We therefore
    provide the data as CSV (comma-separated values) files,
    which can be read and analysed by common spreadsheet programs like
    Excel or LibreOffice.</p>

    <p>As TED is a very large database, extracts are divided into slices
    by country and year. This should make the data small enough to be
    handled in desktop applications. Further, there are two types of
    extracts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Document extracts</strong> contain all activties
      published in TED, including tender announcements, metadata on
      contract awards etc. Use this data if you want to get an
      overview of the activities in European procurement.</li>
      <li><strong>Contracts extracts</strong> contain only the subset
      of TED activities which relates to contract awards. This data
      includes the supplier names and contract amounts for contracts
      which have been awarded to a specific company.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="pull-right">
      <select id="select-section" class="form-control">

          <option value="{{table.section}}">

          </option>
        {% endfor %}

    <p>Last update: <strong>{{last_update}}</strong>. The Publications Office of the European Union

    <h2 id="contribute">Get involved</h2>

    <p>OpenTED is run by volunteers who want to make this data easier to access. If
    you're interested, please consider contributing to the project in one of these
    ways:</p>

    <p><strong>Use the data</strong> and tell us about it. Whether you're a journalist,
    policy analyst or academic, TED may be an interesting resource for your work. If
    you do derive stories or papers from this data, please let us know and we'll
    gladly post a link here. At the moment, OpenTED data is used by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://openinterests.eu">OpenInterests.eu</a>, an influence mapping
      project that combines procurement data of EU agencies with the EU lobby and expert
      group registers to give users an overview of who is benefitting how from EU, and
      how they contribute to policy making.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Help us create a data dictionary</strong> so that we get a better
    overview of what the meaning of the various fields in the source data is. Some of
    the fields are only set for certain types of contracts or in certain countries,
    and we need to develop an understanding of these rules.</p>

    <p>The data dictionary is collected in <a href="#dictionary">a spreadsheet</a>, if you
    would like to contribute to it, please request access so that you can edit it.</p>

    <p><strong>Improve our code</strong> so that we have a more accurate process for
    getting the data out. OpenTED consists of the following - openly licensed - code
    components:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/pudo/monnet"><i class="fa fa-github"></i>
        pudo/monnet</a> is a set of scrapers for EU data sources, including the
        TED database. The scraper generates a SQL database of the TED documents.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/opented/opented"><i class="fa fa-github"></i>
        opented/opented</a> uses the database generated by monnet to generate
        this web site and the data extracts offered here.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="dictionary">What's in the data?</h2>

    <p>To help users understand the data shared in the extracts, we're creating a
    <a href="http://goo.gl/n6STPU">data dictionary</a> that details the meaning of
    each column in the data. This document is unfinished; if you're interested in 
    helping to complete it, please request access via Google Spreadsheets.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2004L0018:20120101:EN:PDF">relevant EU regulation</a> mandates that the following information must be made available. These requirements are not met by some member states, but they can serve as a guideline:</p>

    <p><strong>CONTRACT AWARD NOTICES</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Name and address of the contracting authority.</li>
      <li>Award procedures chosen. In the case of negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice (Article 28), justification.</li>

      <li>Date of publication of the tender notice in accordance with the technical specifications for publication in Annex VIII.</li>
      <li>Date of dispatch of the notice.</li>
      <li>Name and address of the body responsible for appeal and, where appropriate, mediation procedures.
